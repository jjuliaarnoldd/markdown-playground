What was particularly helpful about this documentation? (e.g., organization, layout, wording of instructions, etc.)  
>One element of this documentation that I found helpful was its simplicity. The metadata fields were very straighforward so it was fairly simple to create the record.  

What parts of the documentation need more clarification/explanation? Were there any points were you were confused?  
> It would have been helpful to have some content guidelines to explain what to do with cookbooks that had more than one author. For the cookbook by Jose Andres, I was somewhat confused on how to include the name of the second author. 

Any other suggestions for improvement.  
>I think the title could have used a bit more imagination so that users would have a more specific idea of what the collection contained.
